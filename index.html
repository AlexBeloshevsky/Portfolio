        <h2>A Junior web developer with marketing experience</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">
                Hello, I'm Alex, your new junior front-end developer. I have taught myself front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery using the power of the internet. I also bring with me extansive online marketing experience handling PPC budgets in the USD 6 figure range (monthly).

          <h3>modern web technologies</h3>
          <p>
          I have built this website in order to showcase my abilities, using modern web technologies. I tried to use as little frameworks and plugins as possible so this website is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery as I have learned while studying by myself.

          <h3>Self learning &mdash; projects</h3>
          <p>
          I believe that the best way to learn is by experimentation, and I have therefore made it a priority to learn by building front-end projects. The next section shows several of my projects with brief explanations on the techniques used and lessons I have learned.

          <h3>High budget PPC and funnel optimization</h3>
          <p>
          for the last 4 years I have been managing very large scale Adwords PPC campaigns in the American, European and Israeli markets. I also have experience with marketing on Facebook and GDN (but in smaller scales) and with funnel optimization through rigorous a/b testing.

          <h3>The future - PHP and more projects</h3>
          <p>
          I believe that life is full of learning opportunities. In the near future I plan on deepening my knowledge by taking a course on PHP and trying to build more and larger projects. Perhaps a website which allows famalies to share and edit together shopping lists?
